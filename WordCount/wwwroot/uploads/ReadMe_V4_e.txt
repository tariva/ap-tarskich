The purpose of this example is to demonstrate an approach for solving a problem for an actual user.
Below, there is a description of the scenario with some of the technical requirements as well. 
However, it is up to you to choose how are you going to solve the problem and how the final 
technical solution (the application) is going to look like. 
Quality of the solution (e.g. code quality) is important.

*** Scenario ***

-	A customer needs a small utility for processing a text file.
-	The user interface shall allow the user to specify the text file to be processed.
-	This file shall be analyzed and all the words within the file shall be extracted and counted.
-	As a result, a simple two-column table shall be shown.
-	The first column shall contain words, while the second one shall contain their occurrences.
-	The table shall be sorted by the number of occurrences.
-	The user shall be able to cancel the processing of the file.

*** Technical requirements ***

-	The program shall read an ANSI text file. The file to be read shall be specified by the user.
-	Separating the words out of the text file is only based on white space characters 
(space, LR, CR, ...). Handling punctuation marks is beyond the scope of this assignment.
-	It shall be considered that large text files (~50 MB) will be processed, and as such, 
the user interface shall show a progress bar.
-	It shall be possible to abort the program while parsing the text file.
-	The file parsing logic, responsible for extracting the words out of the input file should be 
modular and reusable. This is because this logic is intended to be reused in a future project.
-	It is desired that the parsing of the file offers decent performance.
-	The user interface is required to be responsive even during parsing the file so that the user
 can still interact with the application (e.g. when he/she wants to cancel the file processing).
 
As an example, the attached Sample.txt can be used. Considering following input:

1:1 Adam Seth Enos
1:2 Cainan Adam Seth Iared

the program should display the table content below

Word	Occurrence
Adam	2
Seth	2
1:1	    1
Enos	1
1:2	    1
Cainan	1
Iared	1
